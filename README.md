# TheraFly
Therapeutic VR for direct-indirect intervention on Acrophobia (Fear of Height)

## Abstract
TheraFly is a therapeutic VR experience for people to have an direct-indirect intervention on acrophobia. While the visual experience is a direct confrontation for the fear of heights, TheraFly is an indirect experience for the user to face this anxiety through the medium of gaming experience with an imaginal approach. Position the user as an undercover, the storyline is not directly related to the heights. Rather, we utilize immersive storytelling techniques to create plots for people to enjoy as the player or character in the undercover movies (e.g., Infernal Affairs) instead of a patient who is having treatment with a therapist. The TheraFly system aims to provide both virtual and haptic interactions to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of acrophobia and have a less subjective assessment with data collection of bio signal sensors, e.g., a pulse sensor to examine the nervousness of the user to assess and evaluate the effectiveness with the quantitative result, which is comparatively accurate than the self assessment.
