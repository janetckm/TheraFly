## Abstract
TheraFly is a therapeutic virtual reality (VR) intervention designed to address acrophobia by employing a dual approach â€“ direct confrontation through immersive visual experiences and indirect intervention via gamified storytelling. Positioned as an undercover agent within the storyline, users engage in an imaginal approach, distinct from traditional patient-therapist treatment dynamics. The narrative, inspired by Hong Kong undercover movies like "Infernal Affairs," diverges from a direct focus on heights, creating an immersive gaming and therapeutic experience. TheraFly incorporates virtual and haptic interactions, enhancing therapeutic efficacy. The system integrates bio-signal sensors, including pulse sensors, for objective data collection, which offers a quantitative assessment of user nervousness and provides a more accurate evaluation compared to subjective self-assessments, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of therapeutic outcomes.
